### Case study 1: Marital Coital Frequency
Original: [Marital Coital Frequency and the Passage of Time: Estimating the Separate Effects of Spouses' Ages and Marital Duration, Birth and Marriage Cohorts, and Period Influences](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095411)

> Abstract: To the extent that marital coital frequency is linked to both within-couple and societalfertility and sex ratio, it may be implicated in a wide range of behavioral and social phenomena. Variation in marital coital frequency over the life course as well as across cohorts may thus affect many aspects of the social life. This paper reports estimates of the ceteris paribus cohort-free effects of spouses' ages, marital duration, and contemporaneous period influences on coital frequency, as well as of the correlations between coital frequency and birth- and marriage-cohort factors. These estimates are obtained by (a) using the properties of the fixed-effects statistical model in order to separate the effects of cohort influences from the agelduration and period effects and to control for the operation of couple-specific unobservables, and (b) using strictly monotonic nonlinear transformations in order to separate the effects of wife's age, husband's age and marital duration.

### Case study 2: Power Posing: Brief Nonverbal Displays Affect Neuroendocrine Levels and Risk Tolerance 
Original: [Power Posing: Brief Nonverbal Displays Affect Neuroendocrine Levels and Risk Tolerance](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797610383437)

> Humans and other animals express power through open, expansive postures, and they express powerlessness through closed, contractive postures. But can these postures actually cause power? The results of this study confirmed our prediction that posing in high-power nonverbal displays (as opposed to low-power nonverbal displays) would cause neuroendocrine and behavioral changes for both male and female participants: High-power posers experienced elevations in testosterone, decreases in cortisol, and increased feelings of power and tolerance for risk; low-power posers exhibited the opposite pattern. In short, posing in displays of power caused advantaged and adaptive psychological, physiological, and behavioral changes, and these findings suggest that embodiment extends beyond mere thinking and feeling, to physiology and subsequent behavioral choices. That a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful has real-world, actionable implications.

### Case study 3: Female hurricanes are deadlier than male hurricanes
Original: [Female hurricanes are deadlier than male hurricanes](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8782)

> Meteorologists and geoscientists have called for greater consideration of social science factors that predict responses to natural hazards. We answer this call by highlighting the influence of an unexplored social factor, gender-based expectations, on the human toll of hurricanes that are assigned gendered names. Feminine-named hurricanes (vs. masculine-named hurricanes) cause significantly more deaths, apparently because they lead to lower perceived risk and consequently less preparedness. Using names such as Eloise or Charlie for referencing hurricanes has been thought by meteorologists to enhance the clarity and recall of storm information. We show that this practice also taps into well-developed and widely held gender stereotypes, with potentially deadly consequences. Implications are discussed for understanding and shaping human responses to natural hazard warnings.

### Statistical inference: misc
[Statistical inference in the 21st century: moving beyond p<0.05](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913) (Special issue of _The American Statistician_)

> Abstract: Some of you exploring this special issue of The American Statistician might be wondering if it’s a scolding from pedantic statisticians lecturing you about what not to do with p-values, without offering any real ideas of what to do about the very hard problem of separating signal from noise in data and making decisions under uncertainty. Fear not. In this issue, thanks to 43 innovative and thought-provoking papers from forward-looking statisticians, help is on the way.

[The garden of forking paths: when multiple comparisons can be a problem, even when there is no "fishing expedition" or "p-hacking" and the research hypothesis was posited ahead of time](https://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf)

> Abstract: Researcher degrees of freedom can lead to a multiple comparisons problem, even in settingswhere researchers perform only a single analysis on their data. The problem is there can be alarge number ofpotentialcomparisons when the details of data analysis are highly contingent ondata, without the researcher having to perform any conscious procedure of fishing or examiningmultiple p-values.  We discuss in the context of several examples of published papers wheredata-analysis decisions were theoretically-motivated based on previous literature, but where thedetails of data selection and analysis were not pre-specified and, as a result, were contingent ondata

[Specification curve analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0912-z)

> Abstract: Empirical results hinge on analytical decisions that are defensible, arbitrary and motivated. These decisions probably introduce bias (towards the narrative put forward by the authors), and they certainly involve variability not reflected by standard errors. To address this source of noise and bias, we introduce specification curve analysis, which consists of three steps: (1) identifying the set of theoretically justified, statistically valid and non-redundant specifications; (2) displaying the results graphically, allowing readers to identify consequential specifications decisions; and (3) conducting joint inference across all specifications. We illustrate the use of this technique by applying it to three findings from two different papers, one investigating discrimination based on distinctively Black names, the other investigating the effect of assigning female versus male names to hurricanes. Specification curve analysis reveals that one finding is robust, one is weak and one is not robust at all.

[Demographic Differentials in Facebook Usage around the World](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3263)

> Abstract: We use data from the Facebook Advertisement Platform to study patterns of demographic disparities in usage of Facebook across countries. We address three main questions: (1) How does Facebook usage differ by age and by gender around the world? (2) How does the size of friendship networks vary by age and by gender? (3) What are the demographic characteristics of specific subgroups of Facebook users? We find that in countries in North America and northern Europe, patterns of Facebook usage differ little between older people and younger adults. In Asian countries, which have high levels of gender inequality, differences in Facebook adoption by gender disappear at older ages, possibly as a result of selectivity. We also observe that across countries, women tend to have larger networks of close friends than men, and that female users who are living away from their hometown are more likely to engage in Facebook use than their male counterparts, regardless of their region and age group. Our findings contextualize recent research on gender gaps in online usage, and offer new insights into some of the nuances of demographic differentials in the adoption and the use of digital technologies.

[How Biased is the Population of Facebook Users? Comparingthe Demographics of Facebook Users with Census Data toGenerate Correction Factors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08065.pdf)

> Abstract: Censuses and representative sampling surveys around the worldare key sources of data to guide government investments and publicpolicies. However, these sources are very expensive to obtain andare collected relatively infrequently. Over the last decade, therehas been growing interest in the use of data from social media tocomplement more traditional data sources. However, social me-dia users are not representative of the general population. Thus,analyses based on social media data require statistical adjustments,like post-stratification, in order to remove the bias and make solidstatistical claims. These adjustments are possible only when wehave information about the frequency of demographic groups usingsocial media. These data, when compared with official statistics,enable researchers to produce appropriate statistical correction fac-tors. In this paper, we leverage the Facebook advertising platformto compile the equivalent of an aggregate-level census of Facebookusers. Our compilation includes the population distribution forseven demographic attributes such as gender, political leaning, andeducational attainment at different geographic levels for the U.S.(country, state, and city). By comparing the Facebook counts withofficial reports provided by the U.S. Census and Gallup, we foundvery high correlations, especially for political leaning and race. Wealso identified instances where official statistics may be underes-timating population counts as in the case of immigration. We usethe information collected to calculate bias correction factors forall computed attributes in order to evaluate the extent to whichdifferent demographic groups are more or less represented on Face-book, and to derive the actual distributions for specific audiences ofinterest. We provide the first comprehensive analysis for assessingbiases in Facebook users across several dimensions. This informa-tion can be used to generate bias-adjusted population estimatesand demographic counts in a timely way and at fine geographicgranularity in between data releases of official statistics.

[Challenges when identifying migration from geo-located Twitter data](https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-020-00254-7)

> Abstract: Given the challenges in collecting up-to-date, comparable data on migrant populations the potential of digital trace data to study migration and migrants has sparked considerable interest among researchers and policy makers. In this paper we assess the reliability of one such data source that is heavily used within the research community: geolocated tweets. We assess strategies used in previous work to identify migrants based on their geolocation histories. We apply these approaches to infer the travel history of a set of Twitter users who regularly posted geolocated tweets between July 2012 and June 2015. In a second step we hand-code the entire tweet histories of a subset of the accounts identified as migrants by these methods. Upon close inspection very few of the accounts that are classified as migrants appear to be migrants in any conventional sense or international students. Rather we find these approaches identify other highly mobile populations such as frequent business or leisure travellers, or people who might best be described as “transnationals”. For demographic research that draws on this kind of data to generate estimates of migration flows this high mis-classification rate implies that findings are likely sensitive to the adjustment model used. For most research trying to use these data to study migrant populations, the data will be of limited utility. We suspect that increasing the correct classification rate substantially will not be easy and may introduce other biases.

[Explaining Gender Differences in Academics' Career Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10830)

> Abstract: Academic fields exhibit substantial levels of gender segregation. To date, most attempts to explain this persistent global phenomenon have relied on limited cross-sections of data from specific countries, fields, or career stages. Here we used a global longitudinal dataset assembled from profiles on this http URL to investigate which characteristics of a field predict gender differences among the academics who leave and join that field. Only two field characteristics consistently predicted such differences: (1) the extent to which a field values raw intellectual talent ("brilliance") and (2) whether a field is in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Women more than men moved away from brilliance-oriented and STEM fields, and men more than women moved toward these fields. Our findings suggest that stereotypes associating brilliance and other STEM-relevant traits with men more than women play a key role in maintaining gender segregation across academia.

[A New Algorithmic Identity: Soft Biopolitics and the Modulation of Control](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0263276411424420)

> Abstract: Marketing and web analytic companies have implemented sophisticated algorithms to observe, analyze, and identify users through large surveillance networks online. These computer algorithms have the capacity to infer categories of identity upon users based largely on their web-surfing habits. In this article I will first discuss the conceptual and theoretical work around code, outlining its use in an analysis of online categorization practices. The article will then approach the function of code at the level of the category, arguing that an analysis of coded computer algorithms enables a supplement to Foucauldian thinking around biopolitics and biopower, of what I call soft biopower and soft biopolitics. These new conceptual devices allow us to better understand the workings of biopower at the level of the category, of using computer code, statistics and surveillance to construct categories within populations according to users’ surveilled internet history. Finally, the article will think through the nuanced ways that algorithmic inference works as a mode of control, of processes of identification that structure and regulate our lives online within the context of online marketing and algorithmic categorization.
